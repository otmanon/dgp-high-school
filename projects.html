        <h2>Heat Me Baby One More Time</h2>
        <p> Hot-summer nights, a cool breeze in the air, ice-cold coke in your hand... what could be better?
            These everyday temperature-driven experiences are all governed by the concept of diffusion. This project
            will teach you all about how diffusion works, and have you code up your own simulation of a diffusion process!</p>

        <h2> Keyframe Animation </h2>
        <p>
            How do movies make all those fake digital characters move? Some walk and move like humans, others crawl and move like bugs...
        but no matter the motion, it all boils down to one fundamental practice; keyframe animation!
        This project will introduce you to some of the
        mathematical tools used behind-the-scenes
        in animation tools used by artists to this day!
        </p>

    <h2> Low-Poly Fabrication </h2>
        <p>
         Transform imagination into reality with fabrication techniques, turning 2D images and 3D shapes into stylized, coarser versions for laser cutting and 3D printing.
        Learn and apply common shape simplification techniques to craft your designs, then see them come to life with our fabrication tools!

    <h2> 3-Orbit Simulation </h2>
    <p>
        Our earth moves around the sun, and the moon moves around the earth. This is one of the most basic examples of
        a so called "3-body" system. These 3-body systems (and 4-body, 5-body... and n-body) occur everywhere in nature,
        and being able to accurately predict how they evolve is crucial for astrophysical research, and space exploration.
        This project will introduce you to some of the basic methods of simulating and predicting the evolution of n-body systems, and
        show you some of their common pitfalls and failures!
